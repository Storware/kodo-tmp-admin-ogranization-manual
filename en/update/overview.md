# Client update

**NOTE: The client update feature using the administrative portal is available only for desktop devices**

The KODO allows you to send updates to an already installed client install on Microsoft Windows and MacOS operating systems.

The KODO client will automatically download version of the application that has been selected by the administrator and the user will be notificated that the newer version is available. If user will not confirm installation of a new version, it will be installed automatically after KODO client is restarted.
