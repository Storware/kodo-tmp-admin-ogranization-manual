# Data management

This chapter describes how to manage your KODO data flow.

Files that are stored in myKODO \(folder shared between all user devices \) can be tagged. Tagging will help administrator track and organize stored data.

Tagging can be useful when determining file content \(e.g.: personal or confidential data\) and helps the administrator track the flow of data in the organization.

There are two types of tags:

* **Organization tag** - created by the administrator, can be used by organization users
* **User tag** -  created by the user, it's personal tag and is available only for him

From the administrative portal you can list all files which specific tag.

From this chapter you will learn:

* How to view tags and associated data
* How to create a new organization tag
