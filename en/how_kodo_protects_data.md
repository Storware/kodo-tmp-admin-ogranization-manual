# How KODO protects data?

## Continuous and automatic data protection

Continuous protection means that every time a file is saved, a backup copy is created. If you choose to save more than one version of a backup copy, the previous backup copies match the previous versions of your file. KODO automatically protects all files according to the policies assigned by the system administrator.

If the KODO server is unavailable, the client save files localy and synchronize them when connection to server is available.
