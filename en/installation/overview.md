# Client installation

The KODO system allows to send a deployment e-mail message containing KODO client installation instructions.

The message contains links that allows you to download the appropriate KODO client version for your device and the so-called "Magic Link".

"Magic Link" is a link that contains a special token that allows to pre-configure KODO client and automatically activate mobile device. Link should be used after KODO client has been installed.

Here is the way how "Magic Link" works:

* Run the installed KODO client
* Fill in the server address field 
* Fill in the username field 
* Providing device activation for mobile devices
* For desktop device backup process is started
