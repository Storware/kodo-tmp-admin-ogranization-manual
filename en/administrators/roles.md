# Role

The KODO system allows you to register two types of administrative accounts depending on the selected role:

* **ROLE ADMINISTRATOR** Role for full access to organization management.
* **ROLE OPERATOR**. A read-only role that allows you to view settings and configuration, but not allow changes.

Select the appropriate role when creating an administrator account.
